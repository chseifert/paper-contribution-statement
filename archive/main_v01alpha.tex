Taxonomy used \url{https://authorservices.wiley.com/author-resources/Journal-Authors/open-access/credit.html}


%Note: was thinking of having this matrix transposed - contributions in rows and authors in columns as suggested in https://www.nature.com/nature-index/news-blog/researchers-embracing-visual-tools-contribution-matrix-give-fair-credit-authors-scientific-papers
% adding columns in latex takes more time to adjust this to different authors, though. And this way we can have an additional comment per authors
